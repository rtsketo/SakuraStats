### App Discription
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakura Stats is an app that focuses on gathering, processing and displaying player statistics of a clan and it can help determine which players are performing good in wars, which of them still have low level cards and which are inactive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One the main unique features of the app is the war forecast, in which the app can predict with moderately accuracy the outcome of the current clan war. This could be useful in notifying your clanmates early of a potential loss and making then extra cautious when building a deck or playing the final battle.
