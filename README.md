### App Discription
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SakuraStats is an Android app that gathers players' stats of the same clan. You can use it for your clan to determine which players are performing well in Clan Wars, which of them still have low level cards and who are inactive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its unique feature is to forecast the outcome of an ongoing Clan War with moderate accuracy. This is truly useful if you plan on notifying your clanmates early of an upcoming loss and taking extra caution when building a deck or playing the final battle.



### Features

* [***War Prognostics***] *What are the chances of winning the current war*!
* [***Wars Participated***] *How many wars the player have participated in*.
* [***Missed Final Battles***] *How many final battles the player have missed*.
* [***Last Battle Activity***] *How many days ago was the player’s last battle*.
* [***War Win Ratio***] *How many wars a player have won out of those they have played*.
* [***Clan War Chest***] *Best clan war chest acquired by the player in the current war season*.
* [***Card Levels Score***] *The overall score of a player’s card collection based on their cards' level*.
